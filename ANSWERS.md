- Parallel import. Since php does not naturally 
support multithreading, an implementation could be quite complicated 
as well as process control. Iâ€™m not sure how important for you to do 
import concurrently I would use a queue for import. It is easy to 
implement and maintain. Also, we could implement a retry mechanism for 
example.

- Storage. There is no information about storage, but if server disk is 
used to save tour files I would say there could be a problem. Disk space 
is limited. I would use aws s3 for that.  Also, s3 can push notification 
on sqs service on a new file added.
